# CyberBonk
Jydge-style, Cyberpunk-themed, GTA Chinatown-like top-down role playing game.

## What ?

The first line says it all : top-down cyberpunk-themed RPG. Play some guy or gal into a dystopic futuristic city, shoot baddies, help goodies, or the reverse, depends only on you.

Any contribution is welcomed, whether it is code, ideas, storylines, resources, advices, or simply your opinion on my work c:
